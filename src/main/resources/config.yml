# %fc_stats_<name/count>_<rating, members(top), kills, deaths, kdr>_<max/min>_<Place in the top>% -> fc_stats

# [EXPLANATION] For example, we use the placeholder %fc_player_clan_name% - displays the name of the clan in which the player consists,
# if the player does not belong anywhere, then outputs placeholder_null
# For example: The player is in a clan named TEST, in place of %fc_player_clan_name% -> TEST
# if the player is not a member of the clan in place of %fc_player_clan_name% -> ''
# --- I hope that I explained it clearly, if you have any questions, please contact Discord
